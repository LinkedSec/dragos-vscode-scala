### Some basic functionality working
This release is only for internal use. It requires an existing `.ensime` file in the workspace, and it starts immediately (so you need to create it before starting code). You can create it using `sbt ensimeConfig`, provided you have added the ensime plugin.

To install: download the `.vsix` file and install it manually ([side-loading](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/install-extension#_sharing-privately-with-others-sideloading)): Go to Extensions, click on the context menu and select "Install from VSIX".

It supports:

* errors as you type
* goto definition
* code completion
