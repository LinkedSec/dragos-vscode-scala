# An Ensime-based Scala Language Server

This extension installs an Ensime-based Scala language server. At the moment, the following features are supported:

- errors as you type
- code completion
- goto definition (F12 and CMD-F12)
- hover
- file structure (definitions)

If you find this useful, please file tickets and contribute fixes. I'm working on this in my spare time and fix those issues that prevent me from using it, but I can't guarantee more than that.

If you can't contribute your time but would like to donate, please [donate to the Ensime project](http://ensime.org/sponsor/) instead. This plugin delegates to Ensime for most of its features.
